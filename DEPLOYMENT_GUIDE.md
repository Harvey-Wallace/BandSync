# BandSync Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Hosting Options

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended)

Railway is the easiest way to deploy BandSync. It handles both frontend and backend with minimal configuration.

#### Steps:

1. **Prepare for deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure all dependencies are listed
   cd backend
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Create Railway account:**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Connect your GitHub repository

3. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your BandSync repository
   - Railway will detect both React and Flask
   - Add PostgreSQL database service
   - Set environment variables (see below)

4. **Environment Variables:**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (automatically set by Railway)
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
   FLASK_ENV=production
   BASE_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
   ```

#### Cost: ~$5-20/month depending on usage

   cd frontend
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel
   ```

2. **Backend + Database (Supabase):**
   - Create Supabase account
   - Create new project
   - Get database URL
   - Deploy Flask app to Vercel or Railway

#### Cost: Free tier available, ~$10-25/month for production

### Option 3: DigitalOcean App Platform

Full control with managed services.

#### Steps:

1. **Create DigitalOcean account**
2. **App Platform:**
   - Create new app from GitHub
   - Configure build settings
   - Add managed PostgreSQL database
   - Set environment variables

#### Cost: ~$15-30/month

## üîÑ Deployment Workflow

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)

Create GitHub Actions for automatic deployment:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Railway

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          
      - name: Install and build frontend
        run: |
          cd frontend
          npm install
          npm run build
          
      - name: Deploy to Railway
        uses: railwayapp/railway-deploy@v1
        with:
          railway-token: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
```

### Manual Deployment Steps

1. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   python -m pytest
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm test
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy: Add new features"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Railway auto-deploys on push to main branch**
