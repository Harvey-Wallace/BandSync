## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching
- Fetches all events and sorts by date
- Retrieves complete RSVP data for all members
- Updates RSVP data in real-time when user responds
- Maintains user's own RSVP status separately

### State Management
- `events`: Array of all events
- `rsvps`: User's own RSVP status for each event
- `allRsvps`: Complete member response data for all events
- `expandedEvents`: Tracks which events are expanded
- `filter`: Current filter (all/upcoming/past)

### Helper Functions
- `formatTime()`: Formats time strings to 12-hour format
- `getEventTypeIcon()`: Returns emoji icons for event types
- `getEventTypeBadge()`: Returns Bootstrap color classes
- `getRsvpSummary()`: Calculates response totals
- `toggleEventExpansion()`: Manages expand/collapse state

## Google Maps Integration

### Requirements
- Google Maps API key in `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- Events must have `lat` and `lng` coordinates
- Required APIs: Maps JavaScript API, Places API, Geocoding API

### Fallback Behavior
- Shows placeholder message when API key missing
- Always shows "Open in Google Maps" link regardless of embed
- Gracefully handles events without coordinates

## Visual Design

### Color Coding
- **Event Types:**
  - Performance: Red (danger)
  - Rehearsal: Blue (primary)
  - Meeting: Yellow (warning)
  - Social: Green (success)
  - Other: Gray (secondary)

- **RSVP Status:**
  - Going: Green (success)
  - Maybe: Yellow (warning)
  - Not Going: Red (danger)
  - No Response: Gray (secondary)

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop:** Two-column layout (event details + RSVP summary)
- **Mobile:** Single-column stacked layout
- **Maps:** Responsive iframe with mobile-friendly controls
- **Member badges:** Wrap appropriately on smaller screens

## Benefits

4. **Mobile Friendly:** Works well on all devices

4. **View Details:** Click "More Info" to see complete member lists and maps
5. **Navigate:** Use map links to get directions to event locations
6. **Track Attendance:** See real-time member response counts

## Recent Updates
