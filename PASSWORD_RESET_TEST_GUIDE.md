🔐 Password Reset Testing Guide
===============================

✅ BACKEND SETUP COMPLETE:
- Password reset fields added to User model
- Password reset routes added to auth blueprint
- Email service configured with Resend

✅ FRONTEND SETUP COMPLETE:
- Login page updated with "Forgot Password" link
- Password reset form added to login page
- Dedicated password reset page created
- Routes configured in App.js

🧪 HOW TO TEST:

1. FRONTEND TEST:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Click "Forgot your password?" link
   - Enter email: rob@harvey-wallace.co.uk
   - Click "Send Reset Link"
   - Check email for reset link

2. BACKEND TEST:
   - Password reset request endpoint: POST /api/auth/password-reset-request
   - Password reset endpoint: POST /api/auth/password-reset

3. EMAIL TEST:
   - Email should be sent to rob@harvey-wallace.co.uk
   - Email contains reset link with token
   - Link format: http://localhost:3000/reset-password?token=TOKEN

4. COMPLETE FLOW:
   - Request password reset
   - Receive email with reset link
   - Click link to go to reset page
   - Enter new password
   - Confirm password
   - Submit form
   - Get success message
   - Login with new password

🎯 TESTING SCENARIOS:

✅ Valid email address (should work)
✅ Invalid email address (should show generic message)
✅ Valid reset token (should work)
✅ Invalid reset token (should show error)
✅ Expired reset token (should show error)
✅ Password mismatch (should show error)
✅ Short password (should show error)

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:

If emails aren't being sent:
- Check RESEND_API_KEY is set correctly
- Check FROM_EMAIL is noreply@bandsync.co.uk
- Check Flask app logs for errors

If frontend isn't working:
- Check both Flask (port 5000) and React (port 3000) are running
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Check network tab for API call responses

🚀 DEPLOYMENT NOTES:

For production deployment:
1. Update BASE_URL in backend/.env to production URL
2. Update REACT_APP_API_URL in frontend/.env.production
3. Update Railway environment variables:
