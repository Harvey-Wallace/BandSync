## Deployment Process üîÑ

### Step 1: Choose Hosting Platform

#### Option A: Railway (Recommended for beginners)
1. Create Railway account
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Add PostgreSQL service
4. Set environment variables
5. Deploy automatically

#### Option B: Vercel + Database
1. Deploy frontend to Vercel
2. Set up database (Supabase/PlanetScale)
3. Deploy backend (Railway/Heroku)
4. Connect services

#### Option C: DigitalOcean/AWS/GCP
1. Set up server/container service
2. Configure database
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Deploy application

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname

# Security
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key
SECRET_KEY=your-flask-secret-key

# Email
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# App
FLASK_ENV=production
BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Step 3: Database Setup
1. Create production database
2. Run migrations
3. Seed initial data (if needed)
4. Set up backups

### Step 4: Deploy Application
1. Push code to main branch
2. Trigger deployment
3. Monitor deployment logs
4. Test live application

## Update Workflow üì§

### Making Updates
1. **Development**
   ```bash
   # Make changes locally
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

2. **Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   npm test
   python -m pytest
   ```

3. **Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Push to main (triggers auto-deploy)
   git push origin main
   
   # Or use update script
   ./update.sh
   ```

4. **Verification**
   - Check deployment status
   - Test live application
   - Monitor error logs

### Hotfix Process
1. **Urgent Fix**
   ```bash
   # Quick fix and deploy
   ./update.sh --quick
   ```

2. **Rollback if needed**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous version
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```
